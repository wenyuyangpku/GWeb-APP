This course will take steps to bridge that gap. We will first explore the origins of the modern museum and the history of (mainly) American museums. Then, using U.S. and non-U.S. examples, we will engage with theorists whose ideas have been accessed to inform our understanding of museums as places of meaning making, power and empowerment, cultural authority, and as “contact zones” (James Clifford, 1997). As the theory informs our understanding of how museums have functioned – both in the past and in more contemporary examples –we will be better prepared to engage critically with our own work as museum practitioners. Historian Steven Conn has categorized museums “as places uniquely situated at the intersection of objects, ideas, and public space.”(Do Museums Still Need Objects? 2010) The exploration of theoretical approaches to museums in this course borrows this useful classification – exploring ideas (nation, race), issues of publicity, and the status of the object."

Of equal significance is the student's first-hand understanding of areas of critical importance to the fabric of contemporary art that is studied through the various assignments. These content areas are explored in depth in Seminar providing the necessary background for your investigations. The seminar acts to enrich your understanding of all Studio III Assignments. Third year is a year built around assignments called ""contracts"" that provide a framework by which you can begin to create a vital and productive individualized studio practice. The contracts bridge faculty-directed studio projects with independent self-directed art making and emphasize the research of ideas, exploration of medium and materials, and the development of process and production over the course of the year. Formal instruction includes brief lectures and specialized demos with an emphasis on feedback on your work in progress through individual studio meetings as well as feedback on your completed work through formal group critiques. This semester your faculty will work with each of you towards better articulation and implementation of your goals arising from your studio investigations. During the course of the year, you are guided through a variety of art making and writing projects that operate through two distinct, but intertwined, art making approaches: expansion of your current studio practice into new and unknown areas and focused studio work. It is important to discover new tools, techniques and areas of conceptual investigation in an effort to expand both your knowledge base and your individualized studio practice. No less important, however, is the focused movement necessary for your commitment to the production of completed, well-realized art works and bodies of work. Methods for locating areas of inspiration are studied collectively in this course.
